## System Requirements

### Hardware

- Windows Operating System (Windows 10 or higher recommended)
- At least 4GB RAM and 1GB free disk space

### Software

- PowerShell 7+ (Required for `FileUploadScript.ps1`)
- Administrator permissions to run PowerShell scripts
- Internet connection for API calls to SailPoint
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 11 or later
- [ImportExcel PowerShell Module](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel) (Automatically installed by the script if not already installed)

### Files Required

- `DirectoryCreateScript.ps1` (for initial setup)
- `settings.json` (created during setup by the Directory Creation script)
- `FileUploadScript.ps1` (for data processing and SailPoint uploads)
- `config.json` (required for each app folder)

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Directory Creation Script

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where `DirectoryCreateScript.ps1` is saved.
3. Execute the script:

   ```powershell
   .\DirectoryCreateScript.ps1
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to configure settings.

### Step 2: Verify Settings

- After the script runs, a `settings.json` file is created in the script's directory.
- Open `settings.json` to confirm the details are correct. Example `settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
       "ParentDirectory": "C:\\Powershell\\FileUploadUtility",
       "AppFolder": "C:\\Powershell\\FileUploadUtility\\Import",
       "FileUploadUtility": "C:\\Powershell\\sailpoint-file-upload-utility-4.1.0.jar",
       "ClientSecret": "YourSecretHere",
       "ClientID": "YourClientIDHere",
       "tenant": "YourTenantHere",
       "isDebug": false
   }
   ```

## Running the File Upload Script

### Manual Execution

1. Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where `FileUploadScript.ps1` is located.
2. Run the script:

   ```powershell
   .\FileUploadScript.ps1
   ```

---

## Task Scheduler Setup

### Step 1: Open Task Scheduler

1. Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and press Enter.
2. Create a new task and configure it as follows:

### Step 2: Configure General Settings

- **Name**: SailPoint File Upload
- **Run whether user is logged on or not**
- **Run with highest privileges**

### Step 3: Configure Triggers

- Set the frequency (e.g., Daily, Weekly) and start time.

### Step 4: Configure Actions

- **Program/script**: `powershell.exe`
- **Arguments**: `-File "C:\Path\To\FileUploadScript.ps1"`

### Step 5: Configure Conditions

- Uncheck `Start the task only if the computer is on AC power` to allow the task to run on battery power.

### Step 6: Save and Test

1. Save the task.
2. Test the task by right-clicking it in Task Scheduler and selecting **Run**.

## Config.json Structure

Each app folder must contain a `config.json` file to define the file processing and upload behavior.

### Example Config.json

```json
{
    "sourceID": "12345",
    "isMonarch": false,
    "disableField": "Status",
    "disableValue": ["Inactive", "Disabled"],
    "groupTypes": "Group,Department",
    "groupDelimiter": ",",
    "isUpload": true,
    "headerRow": 1,
    "trimTopRows": 2,
    "trimBottomRows": 0,
    "trimLeftColumns": 1,
    "trimRightColumns": 0,
    "dropColumns": "Column1,Column2",
    "columnsToMerge": "FirstName,LastName",
    "mergedColumnName": "FullName",
    "adminColumnName": "Role",
    "adminColumnValue": "Admin"
}
```

## Operation Details

### Key Features

- **Data Trimming**: The script trims rows and columns from the imported files based on the `config.json` settings.
- **Role Assignment**: Assigns roles (`Admin` or `User`) based on values specified in the `adminColumnName` and `adminColumnValue` fields in `config.json`.
- **File Processing**: Processes CSV, Excel, and TXT files placed in the respective app folders.
- **SailPoint Upload**: Uploads processed files to SailPoint using the SailPoint File Upload Utility JAR.
- **File Archival**: Automatically archives both the original and processed files in an `Archive` folder within each app directory.

### Script Workflow

1. **Setup Directories and Configurations**:
   - The `DirectoryCreateScript.ps1` must be run first to set up the directory structure and create necessary configurations.
   - A `config.json` file is required in each app directory to define the behavior for processing files.

2. **File Placement**:
   - The user must place the file to process (CSV, Excel, or TXT) in the `Import` folder for the specific app. 
   - For example:
     ```
     C:\Powershell\FileUploadUtility\Import\<AppName>     ```
   - Only the most recently modified file in each app folder will be processed.

3. **File Processing**:
   - The script reads and trims the file based on the settings in `config.json`.
   - Specific columns are dropped, merged, or renamed as per the configuration.
   - If group types are specified, entitlements are grouped and prepared for upload.

4. **File Upload**:
   - If the `isUpload` flag in `config.json` is set to `true`, the script will use the SailPoint File Upload Utility JAR to upload the processed file to the configured source in SailPoint.

5. **Archival**:
   - The original file is moved to the `Archive` subdirectory within the app folder.
   - The processed file is also archived for record-keeping.

6. **Logging**:
   - Logs are maintained at two levels:
     - **Execution Logs**: A global log file (`ExecutionLog_<date>.csv`) is stored in the directory specified in `settings.json` (e.g., `ExecutionLogDir`).
     - **App-Specific Logs**: Each app folder contains a `Log` subdirectory, where logs for the processing and upload tasks are saved.
     - New logs will be created for each day that the script runs at both the Execution and App Log levels.

   Example log file location for an app:
   ```
   C:\Powershell\FileUploadUtility\Import\<AppName>\Log   ```

### User Actions Required

1. **Place Files**:
   - The user must place the input file (CSV, Excel, or TXT) in the app folder under the `Import` directory.

2. **Verify Configurations**:
   - Ensure the `config.json` for each app is correctly configured before running the `FileUploadScript.ps1`.

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - After running the script, check the logs in the `Log` subdirectory of each app folder for details about file processing and upload status.
   - Review the global execution log for an overview of the script's performance and errors.

4. **Archival Maintenance**:
   - Processed and original files are archived automatically, but the user should periodically clean up the `Archive` folder to save space.

5. **Re-run as Needed**:
   - The script can be re-run to process newly added files or to retry uploads for failed files.

### Logs

- **Execution Logs**: Stored in the `ExecutionLogDir` specified in `settings.json`.
- **App Logs**: Specific to each app directory, stored in the `AppFolder\Log` subdirectory.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Settings Not Saved

- Ensure the `DirectoryCreateScript.ps1` was run as Administrator.

### Missing ImportExcel Module

- Ensure you have an internet connection and permission to install PowerShell modules.

### API Authentication Fails

- Double-check the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Tenant** values in `settings.json`.

### File Not Uploaded

- Check the appâ€™s log file for errors.

### Task Scheduler Task Does Not Run

- Ensure the task is set to run with the highest privileges.
- Check the Task Scheduler history for error messages.
